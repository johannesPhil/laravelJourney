# laravelJourney

A repository for documenting my progress in learning laravel

The tutorial used for this journey can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-laravel-for-beginners-become-a-master-in-laravel/)

There are times when I deviated a little from how the tutorial implementation of some things. For example, I used docker to run the app up until [section 12](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-with-laravel-for-beginners-become-a-master-in-laravel/learn/lecture/4874168#questions). I also created routes for filling some tables with random data instead of using phpMyAdmin as I'm running an Ubuntu OS
